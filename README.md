# Algorithms in OCaml

This is the OCaml version of different algorithms, interesting for data science.
This project is inspired by the blog post [_Algorithms in C++_](https://towardsdatascience.com/algorithms-in-c-62b607a6131d) by Vadim Smolyakov.

It also contains a evolutional algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) from [Evolution of a salesman](https://towardsdatascience.com/evolution-of-a-salesman-a-complete-genetic-algorithm-tutorial-for-python-6fe5d2b3ca35)
